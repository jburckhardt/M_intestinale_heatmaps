# Assignment B-3: Create a shinny app. I selected option B
# Here are the three features I used:
# Feature 1: sidebarLayout() -> part of the UI layout
# Feature 2: checkboxGroupInput() -> functional widget that creates check boxes
# feature 3: selectInput() -> functional widget that creates a drop-down menu to select an option

# Load the data and then pivot_longer to make it in a tidy format to plot with ggplot2

    # FEATURE 1: This create the layout for both the side panel (select choices)

    # the different gene categories the user can explore. In the main pannel we have the heatmap
    # that will be rendered, and below it a table with the values for each cell of the heatmap
